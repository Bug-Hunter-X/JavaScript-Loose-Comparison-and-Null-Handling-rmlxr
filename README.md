# JavaScript Loose Comparison and Null Handling

This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript error related to loose comparison (`==`) and handling of `null` values.  The `bug.js` file shows a function with a potential issue, while `bugSolution.js` provides a more robust solution.

## Bug Description
The function `foo` attempts to handle cases where input parameters `a` or `b` are `null`. However, it relies on loose comparison, which can lead to unexpected results in certain situations. This is especially true when comparing with other falsy values (0, false, "").  The solution improves the code using strict equality (`===`) for better clarity and correctness.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.js` and `bugSolution.js` in your preferred JavaScript environment.
3. Run the code using Node.js or a browser console.

## Solution
The improved `bugSolution.js` provides a more robust way to handle null values, avoiding potential ambiguity with loose comparisons.
